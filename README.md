# Sorting Algorithms in Java

This repository contains implementations of essential sorting algorithms in Java, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. These algorithms are fundamental for efficient data manipulation and are widely used in various applications.

## Project Overview ðŸ“š

As part of my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java, I implemented several sorting algorithms to enhance my understanding of data organization and efficiency. I gained this knowledge through YouTube tutorials, and I have put it into practice using IntelliJ IDEA.

### Bubble Sort
- **Description:** Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Complexity:** O(n^2)

### Selection Sort
- **Description:** Selection Sort selects the smallest (or largest) element from an unsorted list and swaps it with the first element, then repeats the process with the remaining elements.
- **Complexity:** O(n^2)

### Insertion Sort
- **Description:** Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position.
- **Complexity:** O(n^2)

### Quick Sort
- **Description:** Quick Sort is an efficient, divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into sub-arrays, which are then sorted independently.
- **Complexity:** O(n log n)

### Merge Sort
- **Description:** Merge Sort is a stable, divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Complexity:** O(n log n)

## Get Started ðŸš€

To get started with this project, simply clone this repository and open the desired sorting algorithm file in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA). No additional setup is required!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jawwadkhan777/Sorting-Techniques.git
```
